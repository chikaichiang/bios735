Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning for Wine Quality Prediction: In this PhD-level statistical computing project, the Vinho Verde Wine Quality dataset was analyzed to identify predictors of wine quality and type (red vs. white). Binomial regression with Newton-Raphson (NR) was applied for quality scores, and logistic regression was used for wine type classification. Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models were incorporated for comparison. Bayesian MCMC methods (Metropolis-Hastings/Gibbs sampling) were implemented for parameter estimation, with hand derivation of model priors and likelihood functions. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, with 10-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and test set evaluation. Variable selection was performed by removing highly correlated features to enhance model interpretability. A custom R package was developed for implementation, testing, and documentation.
