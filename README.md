Wine Color and Quality Prediction Using Optimization and Machine Learning: Collaborated on a PhD-level statistical computing project analyzing the Vinho Verde Wine Quality dataset. Used binomial regression with Newton-Raphson to model ordinal wine quality scores, deriving likelihood and Wald test statistics. For binary classification of wine quality and color (red vs. white), applied Bayesian logistic regression with both non-informative and “inexpert” informative priors, estimated via MCMC with Metropolis-Hastings. Benchmarked classification performance against frequentist logistic regression, support vector classifiers (SVC) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models using accuracy, precision, and recall. Demonstrated significant improvement from Bayesian methods of precision and recall. Developed a custom R package for model implementation, testing, and reproducible documentation.
